# Game Instructions:

# 1.) Think of an animal.

# 2.) The AI will ask you yes/no questions to guess the animal.
 
# 3.) If the AI can't guess it, you can teach it by providing the name of the animal and a distinguishing question.

# 4.) The AI learns from your inputs and will improve its guessing ability over time.


# Data Storage:

# The game stores the questions and animals in a animals.json file. The first time you run the game, it will create this file with default data.
